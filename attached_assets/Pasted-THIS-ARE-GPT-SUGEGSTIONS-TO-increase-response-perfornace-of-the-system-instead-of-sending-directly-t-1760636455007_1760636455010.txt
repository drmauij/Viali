THIS ARE GPT SUGEGSTIONS TO increase response perfornace of the system instead of sending directly to vision ai


The fast browser pipeline

Capture + pre-filter (Web APIs)

Use getUserMedia({ video: { facingMode: "environment" } }).

Grab a short burst (300–500 ms), pick the sharpest frame (Laplacian variance) and auto-crop to the monitor with a simple quad transform (homography) using canvas + OffscreenCanvas.

Convert to grayscale, adaptive threshold, light unsharp mask. Keep each ROI ~160–256 px high.

Detect ROIs once per frame

Load a tiny object detector in-browser (ONNX Runtime Web) to locate HR, SpO2, BP, RR, EtCO2 boxes.

Package: onnxruntime-web (runs on WebGPU if available, else WebGL/CPU).

Model: a nano YOLO exported to ONNX (~3–7 MB). You only need a handful of classes (those five).

Detection per frame is typically <30 ms on a modern laptop with WebGPU.

OCR without Tesseract

Option A (general OCR): Use ONNX Runtime Web with a lightweight OCR recognizer (digit-biased). Many OCR rec models work fine when you feed clean, cropped ROIs; stick to digits + “/” charset to cut latency.

Option B (seven-segment digits): For fields that are pure seven-segment (HR, RR, SpO₂ digits), skip OCR entirely—decode digits by checking the 7 segment regions after thresholding. This is extremely fast and very accurate on monitor fonts.

Confidence gating + tiny LLM fallback

If a value fails range checks or a regex (e.g., BP like 120/8O), or your OCR confidence < 0.9, then call GPT-4o-mini with just that single cropped ROI (not the whole photo) and response_format: "json_object". Do calls in parallel for any problematic fields.

Post-process with guardrails

Clamp to plausible ranges (HR 20–240; SpO₂ 50–100; RR 4–60; EtCO₂ 0–80).

Fix common confusions: O→0, I/l→1, S→5.

Median-of-3 over the last three reads to avoid flicker before writing to your record.

Practical tips that move the needle

Resize early: don’t exceed ~768 px width for the full frame before detection; ROIs ~160–256 px height are enough for digits.

JPEG quality 0.7–0.8 for fallback crops; crops are tiny → upload in milliseconds.

Parallel everything: Promise.all() for LLM fallbacks; keep a single fetch agent (HTTP/2 keep-alive).

WebGPU first: enable executionProviders: ['webgpu','webgl','wasm'] for ONNX Runtime Web.

Debounce writes: update your record at 1–2 Hz with a rolling median to avoid spammy updates.
