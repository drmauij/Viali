Design goal: Recreate the ergonomics of the provided screenshots (timeline-centric intra-op sheet, right sidebar with structured fields, pre-op checklist cards, and a compact case overview + print preview). Match layout and interaction patterns; keep everything editable manually with optional AI-assist actions.

Screens to build

Patient list & detail

List: search, filters (tags, last ASA), create patient.

Detail: demographics (de-identified allowed), chips for allergies/ASA, table of cases with status, ‚ÄúNew case‚Äù.

Case workspace with tabs (sticky header: patient + case summary)

Tabs: Pre-op | Anesthesia | Post-op | Exports | Audit.

Pre-op tab (based on your third screenshot)

Top cards: Planned procedure, OP date, urgency (color badges), location, surgeon.

Classification grid: ASA radio, METs (activity bands), capacity/orientation, dentition, Mallampati I‚ÄìIV, anticipated intubation problems, PONV risk checkbox set.

Planned procedures: checkboxes (Intubation, LMA, Mask, Blocks, Analgesia, etc.), ‚ÄúExtras‚Äù (artery, CVC, jet ventilation, prone etc.).

History & special notes panels.

AI Assist panel (right drawer or bottom sheet):

Upload PDF/image OR paste text ‚Üí redaction preview (original vs redacted).

Button ‚ÄúExtract & Propose‚Äù ‚Üí propose ASA + anesthesia plan + fillable fields.

Per-field accept/decline with inline diff.

Save banner with validation.

Anesthesia tab (based on your first two screenshots)

Timeline area (full width, top):

Minute scale across the top with zoom.

Series dots/lines: NIBP (blue), HR (red), optional IBP channels, shaded anesthesia window, OR room segments (Saal/Bedt).

Hover ‚Üí crosshair and tooltip with timestamp + values.

Bands below the chart (stacked rows):

Heart rhythm strip label.

Numeric vitals ticker (SpO‚ÇÇ, Temp, etc.) at discrete times.

Events/Measures lane with icons (N, RL, O‚ÇÇ, positioning, incision, extubation). Drag to adjust time.

Medications swimlanes (one lane per active infusion/TCI; discrete dots for boluses; numeric dose labels). Dotted red line for target/rate if applicable.

Ventilation parameters bar/line (mode labels: PCV, PSV, CPAP; parameters like PEEP, Ppeak).

Installations lane for lines/airway (IV gauge & site badges, A-line, CVC, ETT size, LMA).

Right info panel (sticky, like your screenshots):

Case information (planned surgery/date, ASA, allergies).

Personnel list with timestamps.

Access/lines, techniques, airway block with start/end.

Comments/notes.

Controls row:

‚ÄúUpload monitor photo‚Äù ‚Üí AI parse ‚Üí preview ‚Üí ‚ÄúAppend to timeline‚Äù.

‚ÄúRecord/Upload voice‚Äù ‚Üí transcribe ‚Üí parse ‚Üí event proposal.

‚ÄúAdd manual‚Äù menus: Vital, Event, Drug (bolus/infusion/TCI), Installation, Airway.

Undo/Redo, Zoom in/out.

Inline edit on all entries; audit chip shows source (manual/vision/voice).

Post-op tab

Compact timeline + vitals table.

Fields: pain score, sedation, PONV, complications, analgesia given, disposition.

Same AI/photo/voice helpers.

Exports tab

PDF preview (right pane) mirroring the anesthesia sheet layout.

Buttons: Download PDF, Download CSV (long form).

Audit tab

Chronological list: user, action, entity, timestamp; expandable to show AI prompt/response metadata.

üß≠ Interactions & ergonomics to copy from the screenshots

Dense but scannable grid; subtle row tints per band.

Small iconography for event types; hover tooltips with legend text.

Right panel with collapsible sections; start/end times per item with traffic-light badges.

Timeline drag handles for durations; snapping to minute grid.

Color coding consistent across the app (NIBP blue, HR red, SpO‚ÇÇ violet/indigo, infusions green area, warnings amber/red).

Sticky headers on scroll.

üé® Suggested palette (extracted from your images)

Use these as a base; adjust as needed for contrast:

Neutrals: #e8edeb, #ebedec, #adafae, #a9abac, #b9c7b8

Blues/Cyans (lines, chrome): #a8d2e3, #abd0dd, #a5b0cf

Accents (alerts & meds): #ece9ae, #f5efb4, #fdfc7b, #dea5ac

Typography: compact sans (e.g., Inter/Source Sans), 12‚Äì14px base with 11px for dense labels; bold only for section titles and current values.

üß© Data wiring (what each UI component reads/writes)

All tabs operate on the entities we already defined: Patient, Case, PreopRecord, AnesthesiaRecord, PostopRecord, TimelineEntry, Attachment, AuditEntry.

Timeline series read from TimelineEntry:

vitals keys: HR, NIBP_sys, NIBP_dia, NIBP_mean, SpO2, Temp

ventilation keys: EtCO2, RR, TV, FiO2, PEEP, Ppeak, Pmean, MAC, TOF_count, TCI_target, Pump_rate

Right panel sections are derived from Case, AnesthesiaRecord (airwayManagement, lines), and PreopRecord (allergies, ASA, notes).

Inline edits create/patch TimelineEntry rows and log an AuditEntry.

ü§ñ AI hooks (keep the same privacy rules)

Pre-op AI: /api/cases/:caseId/preop/extract
Input: redacted text or redacted images ‚Üí return fields + proposed_ASA, proposed_anesthesia_plan.
UI: show diff per field; accepting writes to PreopRecord.

Monitor photo AI: /api/cases/:caseId/frames
Input: locally blurred image ‚Üí return normalized map; append TimelineEntry (source="vision").

Voice AI: /api/cases/:caseId/voice
Input: audio ‚Üí STT ‚Üí event JSON; append TimelineEntry (source="voice").

Always store aiAudit (prompt/model/masks) and require user approval before commit.

üß™ UI acceptance checklist

Timeline renders your sample pattern: blue NIBP points with shaded region; red HR hearts; SpO‚ÇÇ band; numeric tickers along time.

Draggable event bars; hover tooltips with timestamp + values.

Right info panel mirrors your structure: personnel & times, lines with start/end, techniques, airway notes, comments.

Pre-op grid looks like your screenshot (classification & planned procedures).

PDF preview resembles the anesthesia sheet (layout and color cues).
